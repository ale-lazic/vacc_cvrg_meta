# vacc_cvrg_meta

An internal meta-analysis of changes in vaccination intention from the situation when no or low (10% or 20%) vaccination coverage was communicated to the situation when high (80% or 90%) vaccination coverage was communicated.

Effects for "Paper 2 Experiment" were computed using the data reported in:

* Lazić, A., Kalinova, K. N., Packer, J., Pae, R., Petrović, M. B., Popović, D., Sievert, D. E. C., & Stafford-Johnson, N. (2021). Social nudges for vaccination: How communicating herd behaviour influences vaccination intentions. _British Journal of Health Psychology_, _26_(4), 1219–1237. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12556

Effects for "Paper 3 Experiment 1" and "Paper 3 Experiment 2" were computed using the data reported in:

* Lazić, A., & Žeželj, I. (2025). Should public communication of vaccination rates assume rationality, normativity or reasonableness? Insights from three preregistered experiments. _Psychological Reports_. Online first. https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941251340326

Effects for "Paper 3 Pilot" were computed using the data reported in the Supplementary of Lazić & Žeželj (2025) available at https://osf.io/2jsrc.

This repository contains the following data to reproduce the meta-analysis:

* dataset and codebook (vacc_cvrg_meta.csv and vacc_cvrg_meta_codebook.csv)
* R code (vacc_cvrg_meta.R)
