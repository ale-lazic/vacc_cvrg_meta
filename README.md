# Mini Meta-Analysis of Vaccination Coverage Message Effects

An internal meta-analysis of changes in vaccination intention from the situation when no or low (10% or 20%) vaccination coverage was communicated to the situation when high (80% or 90%) vaccination coverage was communicated.

It is reported in the doctoral dissertation by Aleksandra Lazić, _Communicating Vaccination Coverage: Testing the Selfish versus the Social Rationality Hypothesis_ (University of Belgrade, Faculty of Philosophy) from 2025; an open-access link will be added once available.

Effects for "Paper 3 Experiment 1" and "Paper 3 Experiment 2" were computed using the data reported in:

Effects for "Paper 3 Pilot" were computed using the data reported in the Supplementary of Lazić & Žeželj (2025) openly available at https://osf.io/2jsrc.
